                <h3>Ed Sheeran</h3>
                <p>I found a love for me</p>
                <p>Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead</p>
                <p>Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet</p>
                <p>Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me</p>
                <p>'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love</p>
                <p>Not knowing what it was</p>
                <p>I will not give you up this time</p>
                <p>But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own</p>
                <p>And in your eyes, you're holding mine</p>
                <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms</p>
                <p>Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song</p>
                <p>When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath</p>
                <p>But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight</p>
                <p>Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know</p>
                <p>She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home</p>
                <p>I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets</p>
                <p>To carry love, to carry children of our own</p>
                <p>We are still kids, but we're so in love</p>
                <p>Fighting against all odds</p>
                <p>I know we'll be alright this time</p>
                <p>Darling, just hold my hand</p>
                <p>Be my girl, I'll be your man</p>
                <p>I see my future in your eyes</p>
